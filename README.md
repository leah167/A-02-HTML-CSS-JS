HTML/CSS/JS Coding challenge

This quick challenge should serve as a quick refresher on HTML, CSS, and JS. It also forces us to run into some of the inefficiencies that React.js helps us solve later.

Create a website similar to the one below.

It should have a counter and display the same amount of stars under it.

(You can use any image you want)

The count should increase when the add 1 button is clicked.

The count should decrease when the remove 1 button is clicked.

Prevent the count from below 0 (zero).

Upload your app to a GitHub repo and submit the repo link.
